# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains the code and dataset used for the Titanic survival prediction challenge hosted on Kaggle. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, sex, ticket class, and family size.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset includes demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2,224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. You can view the dataset and competition details on the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

### Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
- Engineer relevant features to improve predictive models.
- Train a machine learning model to predict survival based on given features.
- Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
- Improve predictions through various algorithms and tuning techniques.
